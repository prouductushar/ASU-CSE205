Write a public class named SavngsAccount with fields and methods as defined below, and that inherits from (extends) the BankAccount class!

The SavingsAccount class has no required fields.

Your SavingsAccount class must have the following methods:

> a public method named debit that takes an int argument and returns a boolean
> a public method named applyInterest that takes no arguments and returns nothing
> a public method named accountInfo that takes no arguments and returns a String

Behavior of the Methods:

> The debit method should subtract the argument amount from the currentBalance, but only if the amount is not more than the currentBalance. 
  This method should return true if the amount was subtracted from the currentBalance, otherwise it should return false.
> The applyInterest method should compute the interest amount and add this amount to the currentBalance, but only if the currentBalance is greater than 0.
> The accountInfo method will return a string formatted exactly like this:

Type of Account : Savings
Account ID      : 1111-2222-3333-4444
Current Balance : $123.45
Interest rate   : 1.50%

Additional Info:

1. All accounts have balance, credit and debit amounts, and fees stored and passed as a number of pennies (int).
2. All debit amounts will be subtracted from the balance, and all credit amounts will be added to the balance.
3. All bank accounts have a non-negative interest rate (0.02 would be a 2% interest rate).
4. When applying interest, interest amount is calculated by multiplying the balance by the interest rate.
5. When applying interest, interest amount is always added to the balance, and any fractional part will be rounded down.
6. Interest will not be applied to any Savings or Checking account with a balance of zero or less.
7. Debit methods will return false if the transaction cannot be made because of insufficient balance or insufficient credit limit. Otherwise they will return true.
8. The credit method will always return true.
9. A SavingsAccount cannot have a negative balance.
   - The debit method will return false if an attempt to overdraw the account is made.

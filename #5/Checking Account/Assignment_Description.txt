Write a public class named CheckingAccount with fields and methods as defined below, and that inherits from (extends) the BankAccount class!

Your CheckingAccount class must have the following fields:

> a private field named overdraftFee of type int initialized to 0

Your CheckingAccount class must have the following methods:

> a public method named debit that takes an int argument and returns a boolean
> a public method named setFee that takes an int and returns nothing
> a public method named getFee that takes no arguments and returns an int
> a public method named applyInterest that takes no arguments and returns nothing
> a public method named accountInfo that takes no arguments and returns a String

Behavior of the Methods

> The debit method should subtract the argument amount from the currentBalance. The debit method should always return true.
> The setFee method should store the argument amount in the overdraftFee field.
> The getFee method should return the value stored in the overdraftFee field.
> The applyInterest method should compute the interest amount and add this amount to the currentBalance, but only if the currentBalance is greateter than 0.
> The accountInfo method will return a string formatted exactly like this:

Type of Account : Checking
Account ID      : 1111-2222-3333-4444
Current Balance : $123.45
Interest rate   : 1.50%
Overdraft Fee   : $20.00

All Bank Accounts

1. All accounts have balance, credit and debit amounts, and fees stored and passed as a number of pennies (int).
2. All debit amounts will be subtracted from the balance, and all credit amounts will be added to the balance.
3. All bank accounts have a non-negative interest rate (0.02 would be a 2% interest rate).
4. When applying interest, interest amount is calculated by multiplying the balance by the interest rate.
5. When applying interest, interest amount is always added to the balance, and any fractional part will be rounded down.
6. Interest will not be applied to any Savings or Checking account with a balance of zero or less.
7. Debit methods will return false if the transaction cannot be made because of insufficient balance or insufficient credit limit. Otherwise they will return true.
8. The credit method will always return true.

Checking Accounts

1. A CheckingAccount can have a negative balance.
   - The debit method for the CheckingAccount will always return true.
2. Any CheckingAccount debit that ends with a negative balance will incur an overdraftFee (i.e. the overdraftFee amount will be subtracted from the currentBalance). 
   A CheckingAccount debit will always succeed.
3. Interest will not be applied to a CheckingAccountwith a negative balance.
